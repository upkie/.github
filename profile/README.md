**Upkie** is an open source wheeled biped robot design with wheels for balancing and legs to negotiate uneven terrains. Upkies are designed to be built using off-the-shelf tools and components, like mjbots actuators.

Behaviors are distributed in *agent* repositories. For instance, you can compare how balancing is implemented by [model predictive control](https://github.com/upkie/mpc_balancer) or by [reinforcement learning](https://github.com/upkie/ppo_balancer).
